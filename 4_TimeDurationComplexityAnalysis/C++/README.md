## Source Files

- `BS.cpp`: This is one of the main C++ files in the project. It contains the implementation of the Binary Search (BS) algorithm. Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

- `SS.cpp`: This is another main C++ file in the project. It contains the implementation of the Selection Sort (SS) algorithm. Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm. It divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted, which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.

## Graphs

- `GraficoSS-C++.png`: This graph represents the performance or output of the SS algorithm.
- `GráficoBS-C++.png`: This graph represents the performance or output of the BS algorithm.
- `tiempoSS-c++.png`: This graph represents the time complexity or execution time of the SS algorithm.
- `tiempoBS-C++.png`: This graph represents the time complexity or execution time of the BS algorithm.

## Makefile

- `makefile`: This file is used to automate the compilation and build process of the C++ files.

## How to Run

To compile and run the project, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
make
```
